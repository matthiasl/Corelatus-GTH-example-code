Title: example code showing how to create a client API
Author: Matthias (matthias@corelatus.com)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is Java sample code to help you get started with the GTH API.

  https://github.com/matthiasl/Corelatus-GTH-example-code

It includes a firmware installer, a basic GTH API library and a
couple of demo programs for MTP-2 signalling.


Firmware installer
------------------

  Here's a typical run of the firmware installer just showing which
  firmware is installed:

     java -jar gth_upgrade.jar 172.16.2.7
     System: gth3_system_44b. Failsafe: gth3_failsafe_16b
     Currently running image: system

  With an extra argument---a firmware file---it installs new firmware.


A starting point for building Java applications which talk to a GTH
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  The corelatus.gth.* package simplifies connecting
  to the GTH and getting the XML parser to parse responses.


MTP-2 monitoring demo
---------------------

   The best example to get started with is 'simple_mtp2.java'. Typical run:

      >java -classpath . corelatus.gth.simple_mtp2 172.16.1.10 3A 16
      Enabling PCM3A
      Enabling MTP-2 on timeslot 16
      accepted
      Ready to receive MTP-2 packets
      packet: 00 00 00 00 01 88 6B 60 0C 54 68 65 6C 6C 6F 20 77 6F 72 6C 64 06 AE

Logging demo
------------

   'timeseries.java' demonstrates periodically logging L1 and L2 counters.

Building the code from source
-----------------------------

  You need:

  - GNU make
  - A java compiler and VM. We used Oracle's OpenJDK 17 (last checked 2023)

  Once that's sorted out, build the system with 'make'.
