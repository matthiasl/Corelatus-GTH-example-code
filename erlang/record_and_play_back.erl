%% Description : save a bit-exact copy of a timeslot to a file (record)
%%               replay the contents of a file to a timeslot (play)
%%
%%               This is a simple demo showing how to record and replay
%%               an E1 timeslot with a GTH. It's useful for debugging
%%               (e.g. you can be on-site and record a signalling link
%%               to a file and then take the file with you to analyse
%%               later).
%%
%%               The same API commands could be used to make a voicemail
%%               system.
%%
%% Typical session:
%%
%%    1> record_and_play_back:record("172.16.2.7", "1A", 1, "ts_dump.raw", 10).
